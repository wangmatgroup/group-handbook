# TACC resources

A major computing resource is the [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/), managed by the National Science Foundation (NSF) via [ACCESS](https://access-ci.org/) (formerly known as [XSEDE](https://web.archive.org/web/20220820060934/https://www.xsede.org/))

There is extensive helpful documentation from TACC on each supercomputing machine:

* [Stampede documentation](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede2)
* [Lonestar documentation](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/lonestar6)
* [Ranch documentation](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/ranch)
* [Quantum ESPRESSO at TACC](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/software/qe)
* [VASP at TACC](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/software/vasp)&#x20;
* [Gaussian at TACC](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/software/gaussian/)

To get access to the computing allocations:

* open a TACC ([https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/register](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/register)) and ACCESS account ([https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user.html](https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user.html))
* (optional) link your TACC account with the UT EID login
* update the [group roster](https://utexas.box.com/s/722ocwbfogt46wbxoghm2buhw5sn05v9) (group members only) with your TACC And ACCESS username
* email allocations manager/PI with your username
* once you have access, get familiar with supercomputer policies and documentation

{% hint style="info" %}
Before running any major calculations, be sure to let the PI know first! This is so we can make sure everyone in the group has access to sufficient computing resources.
