# Meeting policies

## Meetings

**Come prepared to meetings:** You are/will be the person most familiar with your project, and thus the expert. Come to meetings with questions, results/progress, and where you are heading next. This can come in the form of a few slides, a few figures/plots, an outline or draft for something. The more specific and prepared you are for meetings, the more effective the meeting time can be used.

**Take all individual/group/collaboration meetings seriously**: This is good practice for presenting your results, for "thinking on your feet". Our goal is to be the most critical and supportive of the work coming out.

**Take notes of what is discussed in meetings:** This is true for individual, group, and collaboration meetings. Share with others if relevant. For example, you can make a shared folder and upload meeting minutes. These notes will provide valuable internal documentation for your research progress and gives you a way to reflect and think about how to proceed to next steps.

## Group Meetings

We hold weekly group meetings. These are usually scheduled at the beginning of each semester. Visitors and prospective students are welcome. If interested in attending our group meetings, please ping Wennie to let her know your attendance.
