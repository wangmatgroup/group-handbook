# Filing Expenses

#### **Q: I would like to purchase something for the office or my research project. What do I do?**

Send Wennie an email with a description of the item, what you would like to use the item for, and a link. If it is a reasonable purchase that will see use, it will likely be approved. If approved, forward the purchase request to the ChE purchasing ([https://www.che.utexas.edu/people/staff](https://www.che.utexas.edu/people/staff)).

#### **Q: I need to be reimbursed (e.g., for conference travel). How do I do this?**

Email Wennie for an account number (do this for each expense as different expenses may get charged to different accounts). Find the EID ([https://directory.utexas.edu/](https://directory.utexas.edu/)) of the corresponding person in ChE in charge of payments, travel & entertainment reimbursement ([https://www.che.utexas.edu/people/staff](https://www.che.utexas.edu/people/staff)).

Visit either the department's intranet ([https://intranet.che.utexas.edu/](https://intranet.che.utexas.edu/)), which will take you to the  administrative applications webpage on UT Direct ([https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/services/requests/](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/services/requests/)).

For travel, be sure to \*first\* apply for a travel authorization request \*before\* your trip and a travel reimbursement request after your trip. Keep all (itemized) receipts.&#x20;

Always confirm allowed expenses with your PI.

**University-related Travel and Reimbursement Information**\


* Some international destinations require preapproval from Global Risk and Safety. Restricted regions list: [https://global.utexas.edu/risk/travel/restricted-regions/list](https://global.utexas.edu/risk/travel/restricted-regions/list)
* All business travel requires an RTA, even if you are not seeking reimbursement. You do not need an RTA for personal travel.

Flights:

* If you want to avoid paying out of pocket and reimbursement issues (e.g., cancellation), book your flight via Concur [https://travel.utexas.edu/booking-travel-start-here/concur-online-booking-tool/concur-travel-resources?check\_logged\_in=1](https://travel.utexas.edu/booking-travel-start-here/concur-online-booking-tool/concur-travel-resources?check_logged_in=1)&#x20;
* If you book your flight yourself, include the receipt with your reimbursement paperwork. Only economy fares are reimbursable. Seat selection is not reimbursable. Airfare purchased with points is not reimbursable. If you apply a travel credit to your payment, include the original receipt that shows proof of payment for the source of the credit.

&#x20;Lodging:

* Lodging is paid out of pocket and reimbursed after travel. The receipt must include proof of payment, and the nightly rate, taxes, and fees must be listed. Itâ€™s best to ask the hotel for a folio at check out. Airbnb will include that info on the receipt.
* A traveler can be reimbursed for their own expenses, regardless of who paid. If lodging is shared with other UT travelers, each traveler will be reimbursed for their share. This applies to other travel expenses, including flights, meals, etc.
* When traveling in Texas, state sales tax is not reimbursable for lodging. Please provide the hotel with the Texas Hotel Occupancy Tax Exemption Certificate [https://travel.utexas.edu/forms-resources#taxexemptionforms](https://travel.utexas.edu/forms-resources#taxexemptionforms)
* Different accounts have different lodging limits and rules. Please review [https://afm.utexas.edu/hbp/part-11/5-2-meals-and-lodging](https://afm.utexas.edu/hbp/part-11/5-2-meals-and-lodging)

&#x20;Meals:

* Save your receipts, even if claiming per diem. Like lodging, different accounts have different daily meal allowances and rules. Please review [https://afm.utexas.edu/hbp/part-11/5-2-meals-and-lodging](https://afm.utexas.edu/hbp/part-11/5-2-meals-and-lodging)
* An employee can only be reimbursed for their own expenses, not for expenditures incurred by other individuals. If you pay for meals of other travelers (for example, covering a group dinner), you will quickly exceed your daily limit.

&#x20;Ground transportation:

* For taxis and rideshares, include receipts that show date, pick up and drop off locations, subtotal fare, fees/taxes, and proof of payment. Tips are limited to 20% of the subtotal fare.
* For public transportation, save your receipts and include them with your reimbursement paperwork.
* For personal vehicles, gas or mileage are reimbursable, but not both. For gas, receipts are required. If the destination is out of state, a comparison airfare must be included, and you will be reimbursed for the lesser amount.

&#x20;Rental cars:

* Please visit [https://travel.utexas.edu/booking-travel/booking-rental-cars](https://travel.utexas.edu/booking-travel/booking-rental-cars) for info on approved vendors and direct billing.
