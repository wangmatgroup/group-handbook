# Filing Expenses

#### **Q: I would like to purchase something for the office or my research project. What do I do?**

Send Wennie an email with a description of the item, what you would like to use the item for, and a link. If it is a reasonable purchase that will see use, it will likely be approved. If approved, forward the purchase request to the ChE purchasing ([https://www.che.utexas.edu/people/staff](https://www.che.utexas.edu/people/staff)).

#### **Q: I need to be reimbursed (e.g., for conference travel). How do I do this?**

Visit either the department's intranet ([https://intranet.che.utexas.edu/](https://intranet.che.utexas.edu/)) or administrative applications webpage on UT Direct ([https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/services/requests/](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/services/requests/)).

For travel, be sure to \*first\* apply for travel authorization request before your trip and a travel reimbursement request after your trip. Keep all (itemized) receipts.&#x20;
