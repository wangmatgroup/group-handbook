# Filing Expenses

#### **Q: I would like to purchase something for the office or my research project. What do I do?**

Send Wennie an email with a description of the item, what you would like to use the item for, and a link. If it is a reasonable purchase that will see use, it will likely be approved. If approved, forward the purchase request to the ChE purchasing Valerie Croft (vcroft@che.utexas.edu)

#### **Q: I need to be reimbursed for travel (e.g., conference). How do I do this?**
