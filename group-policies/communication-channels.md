# Communication channels

Communication is key!

There are many mechanisms for keeping in communication with the group:

* Get access to the group shared Box folder. Inside this folder are things such as the group roster, group accounts info, and gorup meeting schedule. Send your UT EID to Wennie to be added to the group shared Box folder. Wennie will make a shared Box folder individually with you- this folder will be used to exchange files and keep track of your research progress.
* Join the [group mailing list ](https://utlists.utexas.edu/sympa)(search for [wangmatgroup@utlists.utexas.edu](mailto:wangmatgroup@utlists.utexas.edu)): send e.g., major announcements here or forward interesting articles/events; say hello to everyone and introduce yourself
* Create a Slack account and join the group Slack using the invite code in the [Group Accounts spreadsheet](https://utexas.box.com/s/217scejibg75iq5k05uocjtuqsa8rrvi) (group members only); say hello to everyone.
  * **Group-related announcements and updates are posted on the Slack, so be sure to join!**
* Create a github account
  * use your github to keep track of scripts and packages that you may develop during your time in the group
  * join the [group github](https://github.com/wangmatgroup) (wangmatgroup)-&#x20;
  * join the group gitbook (invitation link in the[ Group Accounts spreadsheet](https://utexas.box.com/s/217scejibg75iq5k05uocjtuqsa8rrvi))
* Update your information on the [group roster](https://utexas.box.com/s/722ocwbfogt46wbxoghm2buhw5sn05v9) (group members only)
* Get access to the internal [group wiki](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/wangmaterialswiki/Wang+Materials+Group+Wiki+Home?src=spacemenu), which is used to tracking internal presentations and files within the group.
