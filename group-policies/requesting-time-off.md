# Requesting Time Off

**Vacation policy**:&#x20;

Please let Wennie know well in advance (at least a month) if you plan on taking time off. This is mostly to allow for enough communication and planning in the event there is a deadline or event that happens during the time you request off.&#x20;

We generally follow the vacation policy as the rest of the Chemical Engineering department as found in the [department handbook](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/chemegrad/CHE+Graduate+Office+Home).&#x20;

For exceptions or an alternate arrangement, please discuss with Wennie.
