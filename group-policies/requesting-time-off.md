# Requesting Time Off

**Vacation policy**:&#x20;

Please let Wennie know well in advance (at least \~2 weeks) if you plan on taking time off. This is mostly to allow for enough communication and planning in the event there is a deadline or event that happens during the time you request off.&#x20;

We generally follow the vacation policy as the rest of the Chemical Engineering department as found in the [department handbook](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/chemegrad/CHE+Graduate+Office+Home).

For exceptions or an alternate arrangement, please discuss with Wennie.

For more info:&#x20;

* university holidays, which are posted here: [https://hr.utexas.edu/current/leave/holidays](https://hr.utexas.edu/current/leave/holidays); note that only Thanksgiving and the day after are university holidays, even though there are no classes that week.
* what counts for a [Graduate Research Assistant](https://gradschool.utexas.edu/academic-employment) position&#x20;
* &#x20;University [policy](https://policies.utexas.edu/policies/graduate-and-undergraduate-research-assistants).

Depending on your funding, you may need to fillout your timecard to reflect requested time off. Please go to Workday --> My Time and Absence
