# Requesting Time Off

**Vacation policy**:&#x20;

Please let Wennie know well in advance (at least \~2 weeks) if you plan on taking time off. This is to allow for enough communication and planning in the event there is a deadline or event that happens during the time you request off.&#x20;

We generally follow the vacation policy ([https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/chemegrad/Vacation+Policy](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/chemegrad/Vacation+Policy)) as the rest of the Chemical Engineering department as found in the  [department handbook](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/chemegrad/CHE+Graduate+Office+Home).

Note: Periods of no classes (e.g., summers and most of winter break) are not equivalent to holidays. You may choose to take vacation during a no-class period and these will count towards you vacation time. For example, only Thanksgiving and the day after are university holidays, even though there are no classes that week.

For exceptions or an alternate arrangement, please discuss with Wennie.
