# Career Development



### Figuring out your career path <a href="#careerexploration-figuringoutyourcareerpath" id="careerexploration-figuringoutyourcareerpath"></a>

* **This is an important part of your education here, too**: Good science and good research is our ultimate goal, but you need to set yourself up first in order to get there. Set aside a small amount of time periodically for your career development. This can include going to career development seminars, setting up writing appointments, doing a mock interview, etc.
* **It’s never too early to start thinking about your next career step**: planning early gives you time to explore, collect information, mull, and anticipate opportunities. Even if you don’t know or are unsure, having a direction can help you think strategically about your time and energy
* **Do informational interviews /talk to people in that career track**: Informational interviews are a great low-stakes way to make connections and learn more about someone’s career path. Cold emailing works, though having even a tenuous connection to the person is better. To increase the likelihood of someone agreeing to do an informational interview with you, find people who are already active in career development/exploration (e.g., department alumni, at a conference)
* **Find mentor(s):** Having mentors is such a useful thing! Identify who can be your mentor(s), and aim to find ones that cover different aspects and stages of your scientific and general development

### Preparing a job application <a href="#careerexploration-preparingajobapplication" id="careerexploration-preparingajobapplication"></a>

* **Have a master CV:** with everything you have ever done/accomplished (publications, activities, awards/honors, etc.) and update it regularly throughout the year. Having a master version makes it easier to create tailored CVs/resumes when applying for positions
* **Keep all versions of your statements**: You will be writing many statements (personal, research, service) throughout your career!
