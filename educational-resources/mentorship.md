# Mentorship

Having a variety of mentors in whatever stage you are is essential and each mentor will usually cover some part of your experience here.

Mentors can help you:

* transition into a new position and learn the ropes, including conventions (both explicit and implicit)
* advocate on your behalf for advancement and/or awards
* provide encouragement and advice
* provide a support network and sense of community

There are several resources for mentorship that you can turn to (a non-exhaustive list):

* your PI
* senior members in the group
* your peers in the group and classmates
* collaborators, including students, postdocs, and PIs
* your dissertation committee
* your course instructors
* people you meet through seminars, conferences
* experiences of superstar scientists&#x20;

Not all relationships have explicit mentorship built into them and some are more indirect (like with superstar scientists). Like all relationships, mentoring relationships take time and effort to cultivate. And of course, you will invariably become a mentor yourself to others!
