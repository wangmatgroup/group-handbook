# Seminars

**Attend and give seminars:** seminars are a great way to keep up with the field and expose yourself to the variety of research happening everywhere. And what better time to ask questions than when the original authors are there to present! Attend seminars regularly and sign up to give some yourself when the opportunity arises. There are all sorts of seminars (e.g., departmental, student-run) and each can be a good opportunity for disseminating your work and learning about the work of others.



**Ask questions:** Asking questions helps you actively engage with the content and with the speaker. Once you start giving talks, youâ€™ll quickly realize any question is better than no questions. And sometimes the speaker might mention an additional piece of information you might not have thought to ask about. Actively thinking of a question to ask helps you pay better attention to the seminar and much easier to remember.
