# Presentations and Posters

## A non-exhaustive checklist

When making or giving presentations and posters

#### Technical Aspects

* Is the presentation/poster technically correct in all parts?
* Is the presentation/poster self-contained?
* Are all statements and conclusions appropriately supported with data?
*

#### Clarity and Organization

* Is there a clear structure or narrative?
* Does each slide or part have a main message?
* Is there missing information on the slides?
* Are there extraneous things on the slides (e.g., not covered in the presentation)?
* Clear and appropriate use of colors (e.g., projector- and eye-friendly)
* Figures and fonts are large and visible (to people in the back of the room)
* Figures are appropriate resolution

#### Formatting

* Consistent formatting of references
* Consistently formatted slides or poster (e.g., minimal types of font, minimal number of font sizes)
* Updated author list, author affiliations, and acknowledgements
