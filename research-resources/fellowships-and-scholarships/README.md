# Fellowships and Scholarships



* **Be active in looking for funding**
* **Why apply?**
  * Prestige- boost future applications competitiveness
  * Free money! Scholarships are a great way to open up opportunities. Fellowships also often offer a huge bump in your stipend
  * Once you earn one fellowship/scholarship, other fellowships/scholarships and recognition start to follow
  * Establish a network with other fellowship/scholarship recipients
* **Who is a good applicant?**
  * usually >3.2 GPA
  * involved outside of the classroom
  * has life experiences that can contribute to your career
* **What is needed to apply?** Usually...
  * transcripts (check if official ones are needed!)
  * 2-3 recommendation letters
  * various essay statements: personal, research, etc.
* **Start thinking and preparing:** figure out which fellowships you are interested in/eligible for early; start preparing application materials by the summer before at the latest- many deadlines happen in the Fall semester&#x20;
  * Take your time crafting your statements (research, personal, etc.)- it takes many drafts and iterations to polish everything into a strong statement
* **Talk to your PI, advisor, (faculty or student) mentors:** get advice on how to form your statements, get help in editing your statements; people are often willing and eager to help if you just ask
