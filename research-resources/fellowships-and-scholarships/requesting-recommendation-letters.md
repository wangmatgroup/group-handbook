# Requesting Recommendation Letters

Identify who can serve as a recommender- these include mentors, people you have worked with, advisors- and think strategically who can write best about what aspect of you application (e.g., related to research, leadership). Ask for recommenders who are comfortable writing you not just a recommendation letter but a strong recommendation letter.

When seeking out recommendation letters, it is a good idea to give your recommenders (including any asked of the PI) a heads up (usually by email). <mark style="color:red;">Wennie requests at least 4 weeks in advance.</mark>

Include in your request for a recommendation letter:

* any prompts from the application of what should be addressed in the rec letter
* the deadline
* any submission procedure details
* your updated CV
* if there is anything you would like the recommender to specifically address in their letter and any supporting information.&#x20;

Send reminders as the deadline approaches.
