# Reviewer comments

## Responding to reviewer comments <a href="#id-2.revisions-submissions-respondingtoreviewercomments" id="id-2.revisions-submissions-respondingtoreviewercomments"></a>

* **Look at other examples**: If this is your first time with reviewer reports, ask around for examples. Some journals (e.g., Nature) also have published peer-review reports, which can give you a good sampling of what to expect in the process.
* **Be courteous:** Sometimes you may get a difficult reviewer report. Take it in stride, let it marinate, and then prepare a strategy to respond. At the end of the day, it is about making sure the paper we put out is as good as we can make it.&#x20;
* **Be thorough, but not overly thorough**: Make sure to address what the reviewer is asking. Sometimes this involves making changes to the manuscript and sometimes it involves providing enough information for the reviewer to understand the paper. Be sure to carefully read what the reviewer is asking about.
* **Respond point-by-point and mark clearly any changes you make:** Organize your response, making sure it is clear which response addresses which comments and where specifically any changes were made. Create a document highlighting changes to the manuscript (e.g., use track changes or a different color). Ask for an example if unsure.
