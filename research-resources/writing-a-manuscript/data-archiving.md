# Data archiving



* **Wrap up the project:** Once we have finished the proof stage and the paper is published, send me the final pdf with a text document containing the full citation (with all author names, title, page numbers, the works), DOI, full text acknowledgements, and bullet points summarizing the acknowledgements.&#x20;
* **Data curation and archiving**: Once we are near a final version of the paper, we will [curate and archive the data](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/wangmaterialswiki/3.+Data+curation+and+archiving).
