# Before you write

* **Collect your data and make an outline**: when you are generating data, a good mindset to have is to think from the perspective of a reviewer- would an outside observer be convinced of what you have? If not, what additional calculations/tests would address this? Then organize it in an outline, figure out what is missing and what needs more work. I am of course happy to meet and discuss this part and find it helpful to think of the outline in terms of the figures to make. A good introduction to making an outline is [here](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.200400767).
* **Identify candidate journals**: this may shape how the draft is written and may help focus what exactly to write about. Different journals have different focuses in area and writing styles. They also frequently have templates (both Word and LaTeX) for you to work from.
* How to write, some references:&#x20;
  * The elements of style, Strunk and White
  * “The art of writing science”, Kevin Plaxco (doi: [10.1002/pro.514](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pro.514))
* **Use software tools to your advantage**: There are many available text editors and word processors. I am a big proponent of LaTeX. While the learning curve may be steep at first, learning to use LaTeX can save you \*\*a lot\*\* of time in the future in formatting. And many journals have templates to start from.&#x20;
* **Get something on the page**: I find writing about the methodology and results/discussion is easiest to write first, leaving the conclusion and abstract till later once the rest of the paper has taken shape.
* **Start with macro ideas** (organization, flow, argument/evidence, interpretation, etc.) **and then focus on micro ideas** (grammar, formatting, graph colors, etc.)
